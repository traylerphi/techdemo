## Purpose

(re)Learning exercise using Laravel and VueJS.


## Background

This started as a timed code-exercise for an interview, but I've decided that I will continue to
build it out.  While the exercise was a perhaps common todo-list style skills check, I'm adding a
bunch of stuff.  Once the basic todo list portion is complete, I plan to step back and re-read
some time management books, and turn this into a full project planner with a ToDo list component.
Regardless of how useful the tool ends up being, getting back up to speed with this sort of 
development should be a worthwhile endeavor.

The fun part: totally eating my own dog food with this project, so using the evolving todo list to...
yeah, list things to do...

## Tech Stack

* Linux (Ubuntu)
* MySQL
* Laravel 8.75
* VueJS 2.6.12
* Bootstrap 5.1.3
