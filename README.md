## Purpose

(re)Learning exercise using Laravel and VueJS.


## Background

This started as a timed code-exercise for an interview that, admittedly, did not go well.  
Undaunted, I am continuing to build it out.  While the exercise was a perhaps common todo-list
style skills check, I'm adding a bunch of stuff.  Once the basic todo list portion is complete,
I plan to step back and re-read some time management books, and turn this into a full planner
with a ToDo list component.  Getting back up to speed with this sort of development should be
a worthwhile endeavor.

## Tech Stack

Linux (Ubuntu)
MySQL
Laravel 8.75
VueJS 2.6.12
Bootstrap 5.1.3
